      <!-- Create a Windows Azure deployment package
		    
			Attributes:

			packagefilename:
					(Required) The name, including the extension but not the full path, of the deployment package or 
					folder to be built. By convention, if creating a package file for deployment to the cloud 
					(packagetype="cloud"), use the *.cspkg extension. If creating only a directory layout for local 
					testing in the development fabric (packagetype="True"), use the *.csx extension.

			[configurationfilename]:
					The name, including the extension but not the full path, of the cloud service configuration file (*.cscfg).
					This file must exist in the root directory of the project (see the projectDir attribute). 
					If not specified, the default name "ServiceConfiguration.cscfg" will be assumed.
			
			[definitionfilename]:
					The name, including the extension but not the full path, of the cloud service definition file (*.csdef). 
					This file must exist in the root directory of the project (see the projectdir attribute).
					If not specified, the default name "ServiceDefinition.csdef" is assumed.

			[emulatortoolsdir]:
					The directory where the emulator tools will be created by the build process.
					If not specified, the default "emulatorTools" directory in the project directory 
					will be used.

			[packagedir]: 
					The target directory of the deployment package file or folder. 
					If not specified, "<projectdir>/deploy" will be used.

			[packagetype = {cloud | local}]
					cloud:	(default) Builds a package file for deployment to the Windows Azure cloud, for example via the Windows 
							Azure management portal.
					local:	Creates a package directory layout for local testing in the Windows Azure Compute 
							Emulator and a command script (csrun.cmd) for you to start your cloud service in the development 
							fabric more easily.

			[projectdir]:
					The root directory of the project. The service definition (*.csdef) and service configuration (*.cscfg) 
					files are expected to exist there. If not specified, the task will attempt to determine the project 
					directory automatically.

			[sdkdir]: 
					The directory of the cspack.exe tool. If not specified, an attempt will be made to find it automatically.
			
			[emulatordir]:
					The directory of the Windows Azure Emulator installation. If not specified, an attempt will be made to find it automatically.

			[usectppackageformat]:
					If set to true and packagetype=cloud, then the package is built in OPC file format, supported by Windows Azure SDK v1.7 and later.

			[rolepropertiesfilename]:
					The file name of a properties file in the project to associate with each role.
			
			[portalurl]:
					The URL of the Windows Azure portal used to generate the shortcut link

					Windows Azure based on the specified settings. A component can also represent a commandline when used with deploymethod='exec'	    
				
					Attributes:
	
					[importsrc]:
							The file or directory path from which the component will be imported, relative to approot.
					
					[importmethod = {none | copy | zip | auto}]:
							none:	(default) No import action is taken. The component is assumed to be already in the approot or to be a commandline. 
							auto:	The same as 'none', but this value could be overloaded by external builders to have special meaning.
							copy: 	Copies from the path provided in importsrc into the approot.
							zip:	Zips the file or directory at the path provided in importsrc and places the zip file into the approot.
							
					[importas]:
							The name under which the component will be imported into the approot. It can be a directory name if importing
							a directory, or a file name if importing files. If not specified and no importmethod is 'none', then this is 
							assumed to be the same as importsrc
		
					[deploymethod = {none | copy | unzip | exec}]:
							none:	(default) No deployment action is taken. 
							copy:	Copies the file or directory specified by importas from the approot into the directory specified by deploydir
							unzip:	Unzips the file specified by importas from the approot into the directory specified by deploydir
							exec:	Interprets importas as a command line and executes it during deployment in the working directory specified by deploydir
							
					[deploydir]:
							The directory, relative to approot, where the component will be deployed from approot based on deploymethod.
