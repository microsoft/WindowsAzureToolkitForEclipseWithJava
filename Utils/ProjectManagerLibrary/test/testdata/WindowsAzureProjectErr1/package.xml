		<!-- Create a Windows Azure deployment package

			Attributes:

			packagefilename:
					(Required) The name, including the extension but not the full path, of the deployment package or
					folder to be built. By convention, if creating a package file for deployment to the cloud
					(packagetype="cloud"), use the *.cspkg extension. If creating only a directory layout for local
					testing in the development fabric (packagetype="True"), use the *.csx extension.

			[configurationfilename]:
					The name, including the extension but not the full path, of the cloud service configuration file (*.cscfg).
					This file must exist in the root directory of the project (see the projectDir attribute).
					If not specified, the default name "ServiceConfiguration.cscfg" will be assumed.

			[definitionfilename]:
					The name, including the extension but not the full path, of the cloud service definition file (*.csdef).
					This file must exist in the root directory of the project (see the projectdir attribute).
					If not specified, the default name "ServiceDefinition.csdef" is assumed.

			[emulatortoolsdir]:
					The directory where the emulator tools will be created by the build process.
					If not specified, the default "emulatorTools" directory in the project directory
					will be used.

			[packagedir]:
					The target directory of the deployment package file or folder.
					If not specified, "<projectdir>/deploy" will be used.

			[packagetype = {cloud | local}]
					cloud:	(default) Builds a package file for deployment to the Windows Azure cloud, for example via the Windows
							Azure management portal.
					local:	Creates a package directory layout for local testing in the Windows Azure Compute
							Emulator and a command script (csrun.cmd) for you to start your cloud service in the development
							fabric more easily.

			[projectdir]:
					The root directory of the project. The service definition (*.csdef) and service configuration (*.cscfg)
					files are expected to exist there. If not specified, the task will attempt to determine the project
					directory automatically.

			[sdkdir]:
					The directory of the cspack.exe tool. If not specified, an attempt will be made to find it automatically.

					name:		Must match the "name" attribute from WorkerRole element from the service definition (.csdef) file

								deployment, .war files, etc). After deployment, the contents of this folder will be available
								the role instance's approot directory.
					[entrypointdllpath]: 	The .NET .dll assembly with a RoleEntryPoint implementation.
